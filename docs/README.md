# Eidotha

**The Platonic Ideal of Tha — a foundational model of abstraction, structure, and computation.**

---

## What is Eidotha?

**Eidotha** is the archetypal, abstract foundation of the **Tha** model — a conceptual framework for how we structure, reason about, and compute the world. Rooted in Platonic philosophy, the name merges:

- **Eidos** (Greek: εἶδος) — *form*, *essence*, or *ideal*
- **Tha** — a coined term for a four-tier abstraction model that spans from concrete instances to meta-constructs

Where projects like:

- [`cpptha`](https://github.com/kjelloh/cpptha) — applying Tha to model C++'s type system,
- [`pyrotha`](https://github.com/kjelloh/pyrotha) — using Tha for immutable, interplanetary data,
- and proposed `vivatha` — modeling human reasoning,

...all represent practical realizations of Tha, **Eidotha** defines its **pure, abstract form** — a philosophical and structural blueprint from which all implementations derive.

## The Four Tiers of Tha

Eidotha structures reality and reasoning into four core tiers. Each tier abstracts over the one below it:

1. **Values** — Concrete entities (things) that *exist* and can be *counted*, *measured*, or *observed*  
   → Examples: `the number 5`, `my Car`, `Great Brittains democracy`, `Jeffs fever`

2. **Types** — Abstractions over values into types (sameness).
   → Examples: `Integers`, `Cars`, `Ideologies`, `Illnesses`

3. **Kinds** — Structures or topologies over types; define *how* types combine  
   → Examples: `A Biceycle is a Frame and two Wheels`, `A Chess Player can use Whites or Blacks`

4. **Meta-Kinds** — Abstractions over kinds; *constructors* of structure, *reasoning patterns*, or *type-level morphisms*  
   → Examples: `For a Ball Game we need some Ball, some Players and some Rules'

## Meta and Defacto Relationships

Each tier is connected to others in **two directions**:

### 🔼 Meta (↑): *Inference / Abstraction*

- From any tier **Tₙ**, we may abstract upward to **Tₙ₊₁**
- Represents *learning*, *generalization*, or *induction*
- Example: From `5` and `6`, we infer they belong to type `Integers`

### 🔽 Defacto (↓): *Instantiation / Realization*

- From any tier **Tₙ₊₁**, we may instantiate a form in **Tₙ**
- Represents *construction*, *specialization*, or *application*
- Example: From `Cars`, we can pick `my Car`, from `Democracies`we can pick `Great Brittains democracy`.

This dual symmetry grounds the **Tha** model in both **reasoning and reality** — from **abstract form to concrete experience**, and back again.

## Purpose of Eidotha

- To define a clean and expressive model of abstraction and realization
- To explore the relationship between computation and reasoning
- To offer a common foundation for modeling:
  - Programming language type systems
  - Conceptual knowledge systems
  - Ontologies and metaphysics
  - Human reasoning and inference

## Why Eidotha?

Just as Plato imagined a world of perfect forms behind all appearances, Eidotha is the ideal model of structured meaning — untouched by implementation, yet able to express them all.

It provides:

- A unifying vocabulary across theory, code, and cognition
- A model that respects both bottom-up emergence and top-down design
- A home for exploration at the intersection of philosophy, computation, and semantics
